- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlors
- 👀 I’m interested in empowering users with data-driven insight and democratizing information that would normally be inaccessible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud-based data science using Python and augmenting interactive visualizations using D3.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that can improve decision-making at all levels.
- 📫 If you're interested in chatting, feel free to send me a message at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarrenls/), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jarrenls), or [inbox](mailto:jarren.santos.js@gmail.com)!
